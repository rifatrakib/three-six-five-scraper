## IMPORTANT!!!

This directory will store the logs every time the scraper is fired up so that we can track the problems, extract, fix, and re-scrape them. This directory will also store the raw response parsed due to each request for unknown yet potential future usage. The logs will be stored in folders according to the name of the spiders and the JSON responses will be stored in a separate `responses` folder where each JSON file will be named after the scraper or a slug inside another folder named after the spider name.
