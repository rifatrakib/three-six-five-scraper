## IMPORTANT!!!

This directory contains the `JSON` files containing the headers and cookies for each spider present in this scraper. The files are generated from the `converter.py` script which utilizes the `txt` files from the `curls` directory and have been omitted from commiting due to sensitive nature of the data. If this directory is present, and you have followed the steps mentioned in `curls/README.md`, then running `converter.py` should create the necessary files in this directory which will then be used by the spiders.
